\section*{Abstract}

The thesis first provides an introduction into variational inference as an alternative
inference tool in Bayesian inference problemes, which allows for approximation of the posterior distribution.
Moreover are the properties of stochastic variational inference for Bayesian GAMLSS models analyized.
Showing that using a black-box variational inference inference algorithm results in
consistent parameter estimates, using the mean field family, for a variety of common models.
Furthermore is variational inference compared to common MCMC sampling algorithms. The algorithm is implemented in \verb|python|
using \verb|JAX| as a numerical computing library and for usage of automatic differentiation.
Moreover are the models constructed using graph theory via the \verb|networkx| package.
