# Stochastic variational inference {#sec-svinf}

Part on stochastic variational inference.

## Black-box variational inference {#sec-bbvi}

## ELBO convergence {#sec-elbo-conv}

The ELBO moreover constitutes a non-convex objective, resulting in optimization convergence towards a local optimum contingent upon its initialization. In stochast variational inference

TBD: Include figure of ELBO convergence for different random seeds and initializations.
