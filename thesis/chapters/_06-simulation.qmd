# Simulation study {#sec-sim}

In this section we inspect the results from a few simulations studies. At first we study if the implemntation work. After that we study the posterior results from BBVI compared to MCMC for a simple Bayesian regression model. Finally we will compare BBVI with MCMC for a location-scale regresion model in terms of the approximation measured by the KL-divergence.
